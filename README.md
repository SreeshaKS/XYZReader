Udacity - Android Developer Nanodegree - Projects 5: Make Your App Material

This project involves redesigning an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a 
living and breathing app. It gives an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. 
It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.
